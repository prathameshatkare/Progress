XOR Neural Network (Python + NumPy)
A simple 2-layer neural network implemented from scratch in Python to learn the XOR function. No external ML libraries used — pure NumPy.

Features
Forward and backward propagation

Learns XOR logic

Demonstrates weight updates through backpropagation

Requirements
Python 3.x

NumPy (pip install numpy)

Usage
bash
Copy
Edit
python 1.py
The program prints the training error periodically as the network learns.

Key Concepts
Forward pass → computes outputs

Error calculation → compares predictions with targets

Backpropagation → adjusts weights to minimize error

Learning Outcome
Understand neural network basics

See how backpropagation works manually

Build confidence in ML fundamentals
